- ✅ REST API integration with centralized configuration
- ✅ TanStack Query for data fetching
- ✅ Mock data and working components

See `olddesign/README_OLD_DESIGN.md` for full details and restoration instructions.

## 🎯 Current Status

Ready for new design implementation! The project currently has:
- Clean React TypeScript setup
- Vite for fast development
- Essential dependencies installed
- Previous work safely preserved in `olddesign/`

## 🛠️ Dependencies

Core dependencies are already installed:
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Axios for HTTP requests
- TanStack Query for data management

## 📝 Development Notes

- API integration patterns
- Component structure
- Styling approaches
- TypeScript interfaces

Happy coding! 🎉
